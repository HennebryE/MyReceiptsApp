# MyReceiptsApp


For my final year project, I created an app that gathered in-store receipts using Near Field Communication (NFC). Receipts are stored on the app, safe in one place, eliminating paper receipts and providing a simple way to organise, return and budget purchases. 

Technology used in this project:
• Android Studio was the chosen integrated development environment for the app 
• NFC Eclipse plugin was used to provide and edit the NFC data • Java was chosen as the primary language  
• XML was used to implement the design and layout of the app 
• SQLite Database was selected to store all data within the app
